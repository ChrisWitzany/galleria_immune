# Galleria Mellonella Innate Immune Model

Mathematical population model to simulate the within-host dynamics of bacterial pathogens and the innate immune response in Galleria mellonella larvae.

Quick overview:
- In the file "experiments" all the main simulations (and figures) can be found. Note that this requires "model", "params", and "simulations" in the working directory to run out of the box. 
- Supplemental simulations (and figures) are in the "sensitivity_simulations" and "sensitivity_analysis", and in "pairwise". Note these also need the setup files in the working directory.
